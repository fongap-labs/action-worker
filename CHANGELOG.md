# Changelog

## [Unreleased]

- fix: distinguish transient best-effort AI review unavailability from required review failure while keeping security and architecture reviews fail-closed.

- fix: treat MODE configuration names as non-Boolean during naming validation.

- fix: add bounded exponential-backoff session recovery for transient AI review failures while preserving FIFO single concurrency.

- fix: move review distribution and release repository allowlists into versioned governance policy.

- fix: resolve the OpenCodeReview distribution repository from the canonical Action Worker repository variable.

- fix: enforce canonical governance configuration names, execution-source allowlisting, and governance-token metrics mutations.

- refactor [breaking]: namespace Action Worker external configuration with AW/AIG system identity and enforce context-independent external names.

- docs: define minimum-sufficient external naming and register AW/AIG system abbreviations.

- fix: prioritize context-independent configuration semantics over arbitrary segment-count limits.

- refactor [breaking, migration]: hard cut shared configuration names and reject non-canonical configuration identifiers.

- perf: bound each normal Code-Pro review task to two minutes so multi-file governance remains responsive while gateway fallback and fail-closed behavior stay unchanged.

- perf: inject controlled CI evidence into matching ephemeral base/head commits so it remains readable without becoming an extra reviewed file.

- fix: order AI Review reruns by the current attempt start time so a reused low run ID cannot bypass the global FIFO queue.

- fix: expose controlled CI evidence to commit-based AI Review through an ephemeral local commit without changing the governed PR head.

- perf: limit transient OpenCodeReview session recovery to one checkpoint-preserving resume after production validation showed a single resume is sufficient.

- refactor: remove the temporary npm bootstrap now that verified OpenCodeReview release assets are published.

- perf: use one-round Code-Pro review for normal workflow/release changes; Triage still escalates high/deep risk to Code-Ultra/high.

- fix: temporarily allow npm bootstrap only when the configured OCR Release asset is confirmed missing (HTTP 404); remove after the first mirrored Release is published.

- fix: serialize Triage and AI Review across Action Worker revisions so a main update cannot create concurrent AI Gateway callers.

- refactor: install OpenCodeReview from verified external releases with runner cache instead of npm.

- fix: resume one compatible OpenCodeReview session after transient 5xx, timeout, network, or overload failures without repeating completed review work.

- feat: add per-Release license metadata with Apache-2.0 as the default and explicit App-level overrides.

- feat: add Code-Air AI Triage before normal PR review, with deterministic safety floors and high-confidence low-risk review skipping.

- refactor: keep Triage and AI Review on one FIFO queue, remove whole-review retry, and delegate request retry to OpenCodeReview plus model/provider/key fallback to AI Gateway.

- fix: clean temporary metrics branches when automated PR creation is rejected.

- fix: use the repository-scoped GitHub token for local work-metrics PR creation and merge.

- feat: centralize changed-source naming validation for Python, Rust, and TypeScript.

- fix: serialize OpenCodeReview subtasks through policy-defined review concurrency to avoid upstream provider burst failures.

- fix: prevent stale PR governance runs from overwriting review comments or final commit status owned by a newer run.

- fix: scope PR governance concurrency to the current control-plane revision so stale runs cannot block a newer Action Worker release.

- fix: surface OpenCodeReview manifest failure classifications and reasons in governance logs.

- feat: recompute and auto-update task dispatch, PR governance, and release governance work metrics daily.

- fix: unify on `main` as the latest control baseline and remove residual `v1` references.
